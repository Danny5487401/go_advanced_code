In the cartoon, a lot of people are sitting seperately in a big net, staring at their own computer screen concentratedly. Nowadays, computers and the Internet connect the whole world, but it also brings negative effects. Just as the caption indicates:“Internet’s ‘close’ and ‘far’.”

The symbolic implication of the picture is to show that the internet has double influences (impact, effect, power, arthority, )on our daily lives. Undoubtedly speaking (definitely, assuredly, indeed, ), the interconnected world enjoys a multiple of (a number of, a great many of )benefits. To cite an obvious example, we can contact with (stay in touch, get in touch, communicate with, reach, out of reach ) our distant (faraway, remote) parents, friends, colleagues and relatives by means of QQ and WeChat efficiently(competently, expertly ). However, despite the above-mentioned advantages, we cannot overlook( miss, ignore, leave) the diverse（very different, various, multiple） disadvantages which it may bring to us. To name only one, sometimes we are unwilling to talk with each other face to face in the same dormitory. To sum up(to summarize, outline ), The cons of the Internet coexists with the pros.

Considering all these factors, we may reasonably come to the conclusion that the impact of internet on our daily life is very significant and extensive. Actually, we should enjoy the benefits of the new connected world but ensure that human relationships in real world are extremely important to us.

Don’t cry over spilled milk.
Get in shape.
Lend an ear.
